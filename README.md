# Egret Engine

The Egret Engine is a HTML5 game engine. It provides modules to handle common game development tasks such as 2D and 3D rendering, GUI systems, and audio and resource management. The Egret engine is flexible and suitable for 2D or 3D projects. It allows developers to work without worrying about low-level browser impelementation, HTML5 performance, or fragmentation issues.

## Platform Coverage

# Installation

To Install the Egret Engine:

* [Download](https://egret.com/products) the Egret Engine Manager.

* Then, follow the [installation and deployment instructions](http://developer.egret.com/cn/github/egret-docs/Engine2D/projectConfig/installation/index.html) 

Once installation is complete, Egret's engine and tools are easy to manage.

# Getting Started

#### TypeScript

Egret projects are developed using TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript. Please refer to the TypeScript manual for more information. The Egret API and ActionScript3 (AS3) are very similar. It will be easy to get started with Egret if you are familiar with AS3.

#### Create a project by command line

Use following command to create a default game object:

    egret create HelloWorld

You may also add parameters if required: Use `empty` | `game` | `gui` | `eui` to specify different projects. 

After running this command, you should now see a folder called 'HelloWorld'.

#### Write your first line of code

By default, the entry point for an Egret game projects is src / Main.ts. To make write the first line of code for your project, find the createGameScene () function, and add console.log ("Hello World");

After making your changes, the code should now look like this:

    private createGameScene():void {
            // log
            console.log("Hello World");
            var sky:egret.Bitmap = this.createBitmapByName("bgImage");
            this.addChild(sky);
            var stageW:number = this.stage.stageWidth;
            var stageH:number = this.stage.stageHeight;
            sky.width = stageW;
            sky.height = stageH;
            //...
        }

Here, we've called `console.log("log content that we'd like to display")`. This will display our log message in the browser's developer tool.

    We recommend using Chrome to debug the Egret project.

Use the following command to build Egret projects:

    egret build

Use the following command to run Egret projects:

    egret startserver
