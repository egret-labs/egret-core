## WeChat Game

## WeChat Html5

** In IOS12 's WeChat, in some cases, when a pop-up soft keyboard is recycled, the top-up game page does not fall. The problem engine is temporarily not processed and waits for WeChat repair. You can add a listener to the `<script>` tab of `index.html` to handle the exception:

```
document.body.addEventListener("blur",function(){
    window.scrollTo(0,0);
},true);
```
