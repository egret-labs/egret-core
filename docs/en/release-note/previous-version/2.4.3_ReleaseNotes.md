Egret EXP Release Note
===============================


Last updated: Sep 11, 2015


Thank you for using Egret

## Overview

In this time’s experiencing branch, we try unifying the frameworks of game and app so that whether developing a game or an app, developers no longer need change engines, they can simply introduce different third-party libraries. 

This change will bring extraordinary game/app performance and a simplified core library. It would also be easier to toggle or embed between game and app. The branch will replace Egret Engine’s main branch after a few updates. 

######Due to API incompatibility with previous versions, currently this branch is available only to experienced developers. We recommend it be tried only for new projects. For production, please use Egret Engine 2.0 Final.
