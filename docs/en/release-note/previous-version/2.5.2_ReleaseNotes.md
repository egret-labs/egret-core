Egret 2.5.2 Release Note
===============================


Updated on: October, 16th, 2015


Welcome to Egret!

## Overview

In Egret Engine 2.5, we unify the frameworks of game and APP. The new layout would be a core library with third-party libraries so that Egret Engine can flexibly meet the different needs from developing games and APPs.
