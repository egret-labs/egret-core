#### Brand-new rendering structure
We introduce a new developer experience branch which includes Egret Engine’s future rendering framework and the second-generation auto dirty rectangle rendering optimized implementation. After a couple of updates it will be incorporated in Egret Engine’s main branch. Currently it is available only to experienced developers who can download the trial from:
https://github.com/egret-labs/egret-core/tree/dirty
